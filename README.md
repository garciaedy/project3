# Review 
A MERN stact 

- For project 3 I decided to create a application in which users would be allow to use the application to a means of storage of their entertainment of books, movies and games they have seen, read and played. In the application you would be able to add an image, title, and a brief description. Furthermore, they would be able to interact with other users by looking at other profiles and reading each others notes and the thoughts of the game, book, movie they used.
